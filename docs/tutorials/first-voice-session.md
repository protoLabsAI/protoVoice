# First Voice Session

End-to-end: from zero to talking to protoVoice. About 5 minutes plus first-time model downloads.

## Prerequisites

- Linux host with an NVIDIA GPU (tested on RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell)
- Docker + `nvidia-container-toolkit`
- ~15 GB free disk for HuggingFace model cache
- For remote browsers: HTTPS is required for mic access. Easiest on a tailnet: `tailscale serve --bg 7867`.

## 1. Clone and boot

```bash
git clone https://github.com/protoLabsAI/protoVoice.git
cd protoVoice
docker compose up -d
```

First boot downloads Whisper large-v3-turbo (~2 GB) and Qwen (depends on the `LLM_MODEL` you set). Fish Audio checkpoints come from the sidecar image.

## 2. Open the browser

Go to `http://localhost:7867` (or your tailnet URL over HTTPS). You'll see a single **Start** button and a verbosity dropdown.

## 3. Talk

Click **Start** — the browser will request microphone access. Once the page shows `connected — speak`, go ahead and ask something.

Try these to exercise different pieces of the stack:

- **Direct chat** — "what's your favorite color?" (routes through the LLM only, no tool)
- **Research dispatch** — "what was the weather in Tokyo today?" (triggers the `deep_research` tool; you'll hear a filler phrase while it runs)
- **Verbosity** — flip the dropdown to `narrated` and ask a research question; you'll hear periodic progress phrases

## 4. Stop

Click **Stop** (or close the tab). The WebRTC connection tears down; the pipeline cancels.

## What actually happened

```

## Troubleshooting

- **Mic blocked** — browsers block `getUserMedia` on plain HTTP for non-localhost. Use `tailscale serve` for tailnet HTTPS, or a reverse proxy.
- **Connection dies after 7-10 seconds** — usually a WebRTC media path problem. Make sure both browser and server are on the same network (tailnet works) or set up TURN.
- **Silence after LLM finishes** — check that the LLM isn't stuck in reasoning mode emitting `reasoning_content` instead of `content`. The stack sets `enable_thinking=false` for Qwen; other models may need different flags.
