"""Filler generators for the channels that pipecat's main response stream
can NOT cover natively:

  - **progress**: periodic narration during a SLOW tool call. The LLM is
    blocked waiting for the tool result, so it can't stream
    "still looking..." itself — we have to fabricate it.
  - **backchannel**: brief listener-acks ("mm-hmm", "yeah") fired DURING
    the user's turn. The agent isn't producing a response at all in this
    moment, so again pipecat's stream can't help.

The OPENING preamble before a tool call is no longer in this file —
it's prompt-driven now. See `tool_use_block()` below; it gets appended
to every persona's system prompt and instructs the LLM to emit 2-12
words inline before each tool call. Pipecat's OpenAILLMService streams
those tokens to TTS before running the function call. One LLM, one
source of truth, no race conditions.

Backend-aware rendering still applies — Fish gets `[softly]`/`[hmm]` tags;
Kokoro gets plain text.

You may use Fish Audio S2-Pro inline prosody tags to sound natural.
Preferred tags for thinking-out-loud:
  [softly], [hmm], [um], [thinking], [whisper]
Use a breath pause to separate clauses with `[pause:250]` (or 150/300/500 ms
depending on how long the beat should be). Pauses around a filler make it
feel human rather than performative — research shows fillers alone read as
fake, but filler + ~300 ms pause crosses the uncanny valley. Use them
sparingly — one filler + one pause per short reply; maybe two for longer
answers. Place pauses at natural clause boundaries.

Examples:
  "[softly] hmm, [pause:300] let me check that for you"
  "Sure thing. [pause:200] Looking it up now."
  "Okay — [pause:250] pulling the latest numbers."
