"""Push-delivery controller for async tool results.

Pipecat's native async-tool path (`cancel_on_interruption=False`) already
implements a version of "next_silence" — when the tool returns, pipecat
injects the result as a developer message and the LLM speaks it at the
next pipeline opportunity (which is ~the next user-silence).

This module layers two richer behaviours on top:

  now          — speak the result IMMEDIATELY via TTSSpeakFrame, even
                 interrupting the user. Use sparingly.
  next_silence — wait for the next VAD-detected user silence, then speak.
                 Same effect as pipecat's default for async tools, but gives
                 us control over phrasing (e.g. "by the way, here's what I
                 found about X...").
  when_asked   — suppress until the user references the topic; keyword
                 match against the original query.

The controller is implemented as a FrameProcessor so it can observe
UserStartedSpeaking / UserStoppedSpeaking / TranscriptionFrame without
needing transport event hooks (which don't fire for these).
